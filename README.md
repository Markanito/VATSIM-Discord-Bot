# Discord-Bot

VATSIM Adria Discord v3 now being developed. Most of the changes in this bot will be in main bot file as Database will be introduced in order to allow bot to be connected with other servers as well.

# FEATURES
This bot is much more then just random Python script, we evolved from the first 730 lines of code with dumb commands and code which repeats all over and makes code messy.
Introduced command and error handlers in order to make sure peoples are using commands which exists and if command in not found it will throw an error. In this version we 
managed to make announcements for ATC and Bookings and also introduced staff commands to keep vACC messages behind the bot. This is not the end we are working on the logging part of the 
code which will allow Discord Admins to check what other members are up to and if there is any reason for suspensions. Also, logging feature will help when messages get deleted by
Staff so admins can check message content once when message is deleted and have a better version of Audit Log available on their hands.

You can check METAR, online controllers, departures and arrivals with ETA calculations (more info will be added soon) so you don't need to go on any external websites and you can 
have this data on the palm of your hands while talking with friends, VATSIM members or doing any online activities. 


# HOSTING
This bot is hosted on Linux server which runs 24/7/365 to ensure 100% up time of the bot. If there is any changes to the bot you can simply reload the cogs and all commands and events
will be updated without bot restart. More work needs to be done here so we can send a message to special Admin channel when bot restarts and loads cogs to make sure that it is up and 
running. Some code optimisation will happen over time as we get more time on our hands so we can have this bot so powerfull and simple to use for all members accross VATSIM.
